The ideal resume length depends on your experience level, industry, and the specific job you're applying for.

## Quick Answer

| Experience Level | Recommended Length |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Entry Level (0-2 years) | **1 page** |
| Mid-Level (3-7 years) | **1-2 pages** |
| Senior (8-15 years) | **2 pages** |
| Executive (15+ years) | **2 pages** |
| Academic/Research | **2+ pages** (CV format) |

## The One-Page Rule: When It Applies

### Stick to One Page If:

- You have **less than 5 years** of experience
- You're a **recent graduate** or **career changer**
- The job posting specifically requests it
- You're applying to **competitive industries** (consulting, finance)
- Most of your experience is **not directly relevant**

### One-Page Benefits:

- Forces you to prioritize strongest achievements
- Easier for recruiters to scan quickly
- Higher information density
- Shows editing and communication skills

---

## When Two Pages Is Better

### Expand to Two Pages If:

- You have **7+ years** of relevant experience
- You're in **technical fields** requiring detailed skills
- You have **significant achievements** that need space
- The role requires **extensive qualifications**
- You're applying for **senior/leadership** positions

### Two-Page Guidelines:

- Every line must add value
- Don't pad with irrelevant info
- Keep most important content on page one
- Never go to a third page (except CVs)

## What to Cut (If Too Long)

### Remove First:

1. **Objective statements** - Replace with summary or remove
2. **References available** - Assumed; wastes space
3. **Old jobs** - Limit to last 10-15 years
4. **Irrelevant experience** - Focus on target role
5. **Duties instead of achievements** - "Responsible for" adds no value

### Condense:

1. **Education** - Just degree, school, year (unless recent grad)
2. **Skills** - Remove obvious ones (Microsoft Word)
3. **Early career** - Combine into one brief section
4. **Bullet points** - Aim for 3-5 per role, not 10

---

## What to Add (If Too Short)

### Include More:

1. **Quantified achievements** - Numbers take space meaningfully
2. **Relevant projects** - Personal or professional
3. **Certifications** - Industry-relevant credentials
4. **Technical skills** - Specific tools and technologies
5. **Volunteer work** - If relevant to target role
6. **Professional development** - Courses, training

### Don't Add:

- Hobbies (unless directly relevant)
- Personal information (age, marital status)
- Photos (in US/UK)
- Every job you've ever had

---

## Formatting to Save Space

### Efficient Formatting:

| Element | Space-Saving Tip |
|---------|-----------------|
| Margins | 0.5" to 0.75" (not less) |
| Font size | 10-11pt body, 12-14pt headers |
| Line spacing | 1.0 to 1.15 |
| Section spacing | Consistent but minimal |
| Bullet style | Simple bullets, not decorative |

### What NOT to Sacrifice:

- Readability (too small = unreadable)
- White space (cramped = overwhelming)
- Key achievements (don't cut substance)

---

## The "Half Page Rule"

If your second page has less than half content, either:

1. **Cut content** to fit one page
2. **Add relevant content** to fill the second page

A nearly-empty second page looks unfinished.

---

## ATS Consideration

Most ATS handle multi-page resumes fine, but:

- Front-load important keywords on page one
- Ensure page breaks don't split sections awkwardly
- Use consistent formatting throughout

---

## Resume Length Checklist

Before finalizing, ask yourself:

- [ ] Is every bullet point adding value?
- [ ] Am I focusing on achievements, not duties?
- [ ] Is my most impressive content on page one?
- [ ] Have I removed outdated or irrelevant experience?
- [ ] Is it easy to scan in 6 seconds?
- [ ] Does the length match my experience level?
