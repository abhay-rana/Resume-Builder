## Skills to AVOID Listing

### Don't Include:

| Skip This | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Microsoft Office | Assumed for most roles |
| "Computer skills" | Too vague |
| Email | Obviously required |
| Typing | Unless data entry role |
| Social media | Unless marketing role |
| Soft skills only | Need hard skills too |
| Outdated tech | Shows you're not current |

### Be Careful With:

- **Self-assessed ratings** - Subjective and often inflated
- **Every skill you've touched** - Focus on relevant ones
- **Buzzwords without substance** - "Synergy", "Best practices"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Listing Everything

**Bad:** 50 skills including obvious ones
**Good:** 15-20 highly relevant skills

### 2. No Organization

**Bad:** Random list of unrelated skills
**Good:** Grouped by category (Technical, Tools, Soft Skills)

### 3. Lying About Proficiency

**Bad:** Claiming "Expert" in something you've used once
**Good:** Honest assessment of your abilities

### 4. Ignoring the Job Description

**Bad:** Generic skills section for every application
**Good:** Tailored skills matching job requirements

### 5. Using Skill Bars

**Bad:** Visual skill ratings (can't be read by ATS)
**Good:** Text-based proficiency levels if needed
