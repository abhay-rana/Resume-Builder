## What is an ATS?

An **Applicant Tracking System (ATS)** is software used by employers to filter, scan, and rank job applications. Over **98% of Fortune 500 companies** use ATS, and approximately **75% of resumes are rejected** before a human ever sees them.

## How ATS Works

```
Resume Submitted → ATS Parses Content → Keyword Matching → Ranking Score → Human Review (maybe)
```

The ATS:
1. **Extracts text** from your resume
2. **Parses sections** (experience, education, skills)
3. **Matches keywords** against the job description
4. **Assigns a score** based on relevance
5. **Filters out** low-scoring resumes

## 10 Rules for ATS-Friendly Resumes

### 1. Use Standard Section Headers

| Use These | Avoid These |
|-----------|-------------|
| Work Experience | Where I've Been |
| Education | Academic Journey |
| Skills | What I'm Good At |
| Summary | About Me |
| Contact | Get In Touch |

### 2. Use Standard Fonts

**Safe fonts:**
- Arial
- Calibri
- Cambria
- Georgia
- Helvetica
- Times New Roman
- Verdana

**Avoid:** Decorative fonts, custom fonts, or fonts requiring special installation.

### 3. Avoid Tables and Columns

Most ATS cannot properly parse:
- Multi-column layouts
- Tables
- Text boxes
- Headers/footers

**Solution:** Use single-column format or ATS-optimized templates like those at [ResumeFreePro](https://www.resumefreepro.com).

### 4. Don't Use Graphics or Images

ATS cannot read:
- Photos
- Icons
- Logos
- Charts
- Infographics

**Exception:** Your signature if applying to creative roles where human review is guaranteed.

### 5. Include Keywords from Job Description

**How to find keywords:**
1. Copy the job description
2. Identify repeated skills and requirements
3. Note exact phrases used
4. Include them naturally in your resume

**Example:**
- Job says: "Experience with project management"
- Your resume: "Led project management initiatives..."

### 6. Use Standard File Formats

| Format | ATS Compatibility |
|--------|-------------------|
| PDF | Good (most modern ATS) |
| DOCX | Excellent |
| DOC | Good |
| TXT | Excellent but loses formatting |

**Best practice:** Submit PDF unless specifically asked for another format.

### 7. Spell Out Acronyms

Include both versions:
- "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"
- "Project Management Professional (PMP)"
- "Customer Relationship Management (CRM)"

### 8. Use Chronological Format

ATS prefers:
1. **Reverse chronological** - Most recent first
2. **Clear date formats** - "Jan 2020 - Present" or "2020 - 2023"

**Avoid:** Functional resumes that hide dates or use unusual formats.

### 9. Keep Formatting Simple

**Do:**
- Use bullet points (standard bullets)
- Use bold for headers
- Use consistent spacing

**Don't:**
- Use special characters
- Use colored backgrounds
- Use borders or lines

### 10. Include Contact Information at Top

```
John Smith
john.smith@email.com | (555) 123-4567 | linkedin.com/in/johnsmith | New York, NY
```

**Avoid:** Putting contact info in header/footer (ATS often skips these).

## ATS Keyword Strategies

### Hard Skills Keywords

Include technical skills specific to your field:

**Tech:** Python, JavaScript, AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Agile, REST API
**Marketing:** SEO, Google Analytics, HubSpot, Content Marketing, PPC
**Finance:** Financial Modeling, Excel, SAP, QuickBooks, GAAP
**Healthcare:** HIPAA, EMR, Patient Care, Clinical Documentation

### Soft Skills Keywords

- Leadership
- Communication
- Problem-solving
- Team collaboration
- Time management
- Adaptability

### Action Verbs

Start bullet points with strong verbs:
- Achieved, Improved, Increased
- Led, Managed, Directed
- Developed, Created, Designed
- Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed

## Quick Tips Summary

1. **Mirror job description language** - Use their exact phrases
2. **Front-load important keywords** - Put them early in each section
3. **Use numbers** - "Increased sales by 40%" parses better than "significantly increased sales"
4. **One page if possible** - Easier to parse, higher keyword density
5. **Test before sending** - Always verify your formatting
