## How to Use Action Verbs

### Formula for Bullet Points

```
[Action Verb] + [Task/Project] + [Result/Impact] + [Metrics]
```

**Example:**
> **Increased** website conversion rate by **implementing** A/B testing framework, resulting in **45% more signups** and **$200K additional revenue**.

### Tips

2. **Match verb to achievement level** - "Spearheaded" > "Helped with"
3. **Vary your verbs** - Don't repeat the same verb multiple times
4. **Use present tense for current job** - "Lead" not "Led"
5. **Use past tense for previous jobs** - "Managed" not "Manage"
